# Uncertainty Representation
This project is based on the paper - "On Relative Expressiveness of Bayesian and Neural Networks" by Arthur Choi and Adnan Darwiche.
[BayesNet.java] - Java code to build a Bayesian Network (small scale).
[NeuralNet.java] - Java code to build a simple FeedForward Neural Network.
[TestingBayesNet.java] - Java code that modifies a Bayesian Network to behave like a Neural Network (small scale).

# Soft Computing
[car_quality_predictor.py] - Python code using Keras with TensorFlow as backend to build a Shallow Feedforward Neural Network that predicts the quality of a car based on its given features.

# Natural Language Processing
[CharLSTM.ipynb] - Python code using PyTorch to build a Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) that understands patterns between characters in words and generates them.

# Information Systems
[b_plus_tree.cpp] - C++ code to build a B+ Tree that greatly optimizes the indexing and searching process in a continually growing database.
[static_hash_table.cpp] - C++ code to build a static hash table that also optimizes the indexing and searching process in a continually growing database, but isn't as good as the B+ Tree.
